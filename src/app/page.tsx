        <p>
          I'm a DevOps Engineer based in Dallas, TX, with a passion for building resilient infrastructure,
          automated pipelines, and scalable systems that support fast, reliable deployments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve worked with Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Terraform, AWS, and Coolify to
          build and manage production-grade systems. My goal is to create clean, maintainable deployment pipelines
          that empower dev teams to ship with confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of DevOps, I enjoy biking, playing basketball, and constantly learning new tech â€” always aiming
          to level up both professionally and personally.
